      <h3>What I Do</h3>
      <p>
        I partner with mission-driven organizations to design and strengthen learning systems, strategies,
        and programs that lead to meaningful impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work focuses on helping organizations become learning organizations that use data, reflection,
        communication, and connection to strengthen systems, improve practice, and support sustained transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach centers people, communities, and relationships and is grounded in an equity-driven lens
        informed by real-world implementation experience. I bring deep expertise in individual, community,
        and organizational learning frameworks, strategy development, and facilitation, all in service of
        impact, accountability, and long-term change.

        I am a strategic learning and systems change consultant with over 20 years of experience working
        across the nonprofit, philanthropic, and public sectors. My work bridges strategy and implementation,
        supporting organizations to translate vision into practice through strong learning systems,
        facilitation, and adaptive approaches.

        I have extensive experience in organizational learning, strategy development, program design and
        implementation, and training and facilitation. I specialize in helping organizations strengthen
        internal learning cultures, align strategy with practice, and use evidence and reflection to
        continuously improve programs and outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have partnered with organizations working on complex social challenges,
        supporting leadership development, cross-sector collaboration, and community-centered program design.
        My work is driven by a commitment to equity, shared learning, and building systems that are responsive
        to the communities they serve.
